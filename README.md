# Grocr
## Description 

This is our second project for the GT Full Stack Flex Program. This project was created to provide a solution for your personalized grocery list! We created a website where the user can upload a receipt of their previous grocery receipt. It will then be put into an itemized list that is modifiable below. You can add items, change items, move them to past purchases, and delete items.
